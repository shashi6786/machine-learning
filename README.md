Repo to hold all the programs i write while learning machine learning skills

I started learning Machine Learning skills recently and wanted to keep a repo to hold all the programs that i write during the course of my learning.
This is mainly pure hands on.

This is a skill that i want to have and aspire for, besides being a JAVA developer and AWS Certified Solutions Architect.
I fancy the ML and AI skills and want to have those under my belt.

This initiative is self driven by me to get to know the basics of ML and AI world during my leisure time.
